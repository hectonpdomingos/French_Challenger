How much can you learn in 3 months?

I have been always in love for languages, even if I did not mastered any (I tried English, Russian and now I will with French).
Now, I have a plan to move to Canada and I really need to learn as 
much French as I can to pass in the exam.

My wife is ahead of me in this one, she is already intermediate in this language.

Can I reach my wife in 3 months? Let's see it.

The goal is to have in 3 months A2 or B1 in French.

I started today 08/21/17 with simple sentences and words that I catched on YT.
I will practice everyday and I will record a audio and upload to github or soundcloud.
After this period I will record a video on YT giving impressions about this experience.
